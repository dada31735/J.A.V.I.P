# TODO.md

_(very basic so far just to have something)_

## Minimal Spring Boot Setup

- [ ] Create new Spring Boot project
- [ ] Add dependencies:
  - [ ] Spring Web
  - [ ] Spring Data JPA
  - [ ] H2

---

## Core Models

- [ ] make uml
- [ ] create the core models of the project 

---

## Basic CRUD

- [ ] Create repository interfaces
- [ ] Create basic CRUD controllers for each model

---

## Run & Test

- [ ] Run app
- [ ] sanity checks and such before even worrying about persistance or actual external connectivity
- [ ] Use localhost/test endpoints to verify basic CRUD works

## current goal : have a JAVA app that has all the basic structure (UML/models) and manipulations needed for the core functions of the project. No persistance yet.
